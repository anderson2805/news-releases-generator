        "article": "Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Zaqy Mohamad officiated at the 25th Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Senior Military Expert Appointment Ceremony at SAFTI Military Institute this evening. A total of 141 service personnel, comprising 25 from the Singapore Army, 30 from the Republic of Singapore Navy, 45 from the Republic of Singapore Air Force and 41 from the Digital\u00a0and Intelligence Service, were appointed as Senior Military Experts (MEs) during the ceremony. This is the largest batch of Senior Military Experts to be appointed since the inauguration of the Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES) in 2010.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Mr Zaqy emphasised the importance of a strong and capable SAF in an increasingly uncertain world. He said, \"The fact remains that we live in an increasingly fragmented world. We witness an erosion of the rules-based order, and countries more frequently resorting to unilateral actions. These global events highlight the hard truth that no amount of diplomacy can prevent conflict against a resolute aggressor, or overcome the acute vulnerabilities that confront small nations like Singapore. A strong SAF is therefore needed to be the ultimate guarantor of peace for our nation, and to do so, having superior technology and firepower alone are not sufficient. Our key ingredient of success is the leadership and expertise that people possess.\nMr Zaqy also highlighted the important role that MEs play in enabling the SAF to build the expertise needed to stay ahead of the dynamic security environment. He said, \"In the face of a complex and fast-evolving security landscape, our Military Experts answer the call to meet the SAF's growing needs\u2026 On the battlefield, tactical skirmishes are being transformed by drone technology and artificial intelligence\u2026 Beyond the conventional battlefield, non-kinetic warfare is waged fiercely through numerous cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns, to disrupt critical facilities and fracture the solidarity of the nation. It is therefore critical that the SAF possess the capabilities to counter these growing threats.\" Congratulating the graduands on their successful appointment, SMS Zaqy also thanked their family members and loved ones for their support.\nThe appointment ceremony marked the completion of the Military Domain Experts Course, which trained MEs to assume roles in the SAF where in-depth expertise in areas such as engineering, intelligence, military medicine and cybersecurity is required. The course developed and honed the MEs' leadership competency, military domain knowledge and specialised skills. The newly appointed Senior MEs will move on to assume leadership or staff appointments in their professional areas.\nAlso present at the ceremony was Chief of Defence Force Vice Admiral Aaron Beng, senior SAF officers as well as families and friends of the graduands.",

The event was also witnessed by senior officers from the RSAF and FASF.\nSince 1998, 150 Squadron at Cazaux Air Base has been home to generations of instructor pilots, Air Force Engineers, fighter aircrew trainees, support staff and their families. Such overseas training and detachments allow the RSAF to overcome the land and airspace constraints of Singapore.\nHighlighting the training value of the 150 Squadron, Dr Ng said, \"The training facility in Cazaux is very important to the RSAF. After the trainees get their basic wings, most of them come here before they go on to fighter jets, and this is where the fundamentals of flying tactics and basic skills are honed. We are very thankful to the French government and to the French defence force, their air force, and the people around here. On this 25th anniversary, I thought it was very important for me to come here and thank them personally.\"\nPrior to the anniversary celebration, Dr Ng also met French Minister of the Armed Forces S\u00e9bastien Lecornu in Paris, France, on 15 June 2023. During the meeting, Dr Ng and Mr Lecornu reaffirmed the two countries' commitment to strengthening bilateral defence cooperation, including in areas such as defence technology and cyber, as well as furthering cooperation on the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus. Dr Ng said, \"Myself and Minister Lecornu shared perspectives on security challenges in our region. He has committed the French defence force to have a greater presence in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. I think it is a good partnership and we look forward to strengthening defence ties.\"\nDr Ng's visit underscores the strong and broad-based defence relationship between Singapore and France. Both armed forces and defence establishments conduct regular professional exchanges and high-level interactions including joint military exercises, cross-attendance of courses, and dialogues. Earlier this year, the RSAF conducted bilateral training with the French Navy's Rafales during their deployment to the region. The Republic of Singapore Navy also hosted two French navy ships, the FS La Fayette and FS Dixmude,\u00a0at the RSS Singapura \u2013 Changi Naval Base as part of the Jeanne d'Arc mission, and the Singapore Army conducted an exchange with soldiers aboard the FS Dixmude. In April 2023, MINDEF signed an agreement with France's Ministry of the Armed Forces to establish a Joint Research & Development Laboratory to develop artificial intelligence capabilities for impactful defence applications.\nAs part of his visit to France, Dr Ng will also attend the 54th International Paris Air Show on 19 June 2023.",

A total of 370 cadets, comprising 269 from the Singapore Army, 50 from the Republic of Singapore Navy and 51 from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, were commissioned as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).\nMr Wong emphasised the need for a strong SAF. He said, \"Our security requires a strong and credible SAF \u2013 one that can give weight to Singapore's voice on the international stage, enable us to stand firm in defence of our own interests, and ultimately, to keep all of us safe and secure.\"\nAddressing the graduands at the parade, Mr Wong also underlined the important roles the newly commissioned officers play as future leaders of the SAF. He said, \"Lead with conviction, lead by example. Inspire your soldiers, not just with words, but with actions. Imbue in them a strong sense of passion, purpose and commitment. Show them that our nation, our people, and our way of life are worth defending and fighting for\u2026 Lead not to elevate yourself or to pursue your own ambitions. Lead instead to advance the common good; lead for a higher purpose.\"\nThe parade marked the completion of 38 weeks of rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School. The realistic training conducted during the course sharpened the cadets'\u00a0combat, planning and leadership skills. The newly commissioned officers will go on to assume command, instructional or staff appointment in the SAF. Also present at the parade were Chief of Navy Rear-Admiral Sean Wat, senior Ministry of Defence and SAF officials, as well as families and friends of the newly commissioned officers.",

Dr Ng highlighted that an adequate defence budget is core to defence deterrence and while the increase in global military spending is not necessarily a source of instability, it is in \"the absence of a strategic framework of engagement and mutual restraint, cooperation despite competition, that balance tilts away from deterrence and the risk of conflict increases\". In the economic domain, shifting trade alliances and the growing salience of nativist economic policies were also strong winds of change that could have an impact on regional stability.\nDr Ng underscored the importance of countries building and maintaining channels of communication for dialogue. He said that \"such channels of communications must be built over time\" and that when \"unplanned incidents occur, that line of communication could make a crucial difference in the de-escalation of hostilities\". Within the region, ASEAN member states had sought to pursue military cooperation in an open and inclusive manner to prevent miscalculation and build confidence amongst regional militaries. This included involving the US, China and other ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus dialogue partners in multilateral exercises.\nAfter speaking at the plenary, Dr Ng hosted a Ministerial Roundtable.\nEarlier today, Dr Ng called on the President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste His Excellency Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta. During the call, Dr Ng welcomed President Ramos-Horta back to Singapore and noted the friendly relations between Singapore and Timor-Leste. They discussed possible areas of defence cooperation between the defence establishments, and also highlighted the value of ASEAN as a platform for practical cooperation and strategic dialogue, in support of a stable regional order.

As part of the conference, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between AISG and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)'s Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) was signed.\nDelivering the opening address at the conference, Mr Heng said that, \"Outside of the defence-specific sector partners, DIS is also enlarging its engagement with the wider technology ecosystem, including engagement with the commercial sector and academia\u2026 This MOU is another example of DIS's pursuit in this direction of engagement, augmenting our ongoing efforts to build and sustain a strong and capable workforce and talent pipeline to strengthen and sharpen the SAF's digital cutting edge.\"\nThe MOU between AISG and the DIS was signed by Head of LearnAI at AISG, Mr Koo Sengmeng and DIS Chief Digitalisation Officer Military Expert 7 (ME7) Guo Jinghua. Senior Director of AI Governance at AISG, Prof Simon Chesterman and Chief of Digital and Intelligence Service/Director Military Intelligence, Brigadier-General Lee Yi-Jin witnessed the signing of the MOU, which formalises the collaboration in deepening national AI expertise for Singapore's digital defence.\nThe MOU will further collaboration and strengthen the DIS's capability development in Data Science and AI (DSAI). The DIS will need to keep pace with, and agilely harness the rapid pace of AI innovation in academia and industry, to complement the strong AI capabilities of the Defence Technology Community. This is crucial for the DIS to better exploit the vast and growing volume of data in the digital domain, and effectively detect and respond to the increasing digital threats facing Singapore and Singaporeans. The DIS will leverage AISG's industry and talent development programmes including the 100 Experiments (100E) and AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP) to expand the DIS's capacity to deploy advance AI techniques, such as the use of Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning, and integrate them into operations of the DIS and the SAF.\nThe DIS will also work with AISG to develop and expand its workforce. Through the introduction of AISG's LearnAI courses, the DIS will expand its course offerings for DIS personnel's professional upskilling. The DIS will also leverage AISG's existing networks of students to sustain the DSAI talent pipeline, while supporting AISG's mandate of growing and developing a national digital workforce. The DIS will enable national talents in AISG's AIAP, who are undergoing AI deep-skilling, to contribute to national defence via their involvement in the various projects supporting the DIS. The DIS will also offer employment opportunities to these talents where suitable. In addition, AISG will share about National Service (NS) and career opportunities in the DIS, such as the Digital Work-Learn Scheme[1], with students from the AISG Student Outreach Programme.\nHighlighting the importance of the MOU for Singapore's digital defence, Mr Koo said, \"Our partnership with the DIS will ensure that Singapore has a robust and resilient pipeline of AI talents that have knowledge of issues related to national defence and possess the relevant expertise to protect our digital borders and safeguard Singapore. We look forward to working closely with the DIS to collectively deepen the core competencies of our next-generation Singapore Armed Forces to stay ahead of the threats of tomorrow.\"\nME7 Guo said, \"The DIS and AISG are working towards our common goal of strengthening digital capabilities to safeguard Singapore. The effective use of AI is crucial for the SAF's mission success. We need to better reap the dynamic AI innovations in academia and industry, and integrate them into SAF operations. Our partnership with AISG is therefore an important part of our approach to leverage cutting-edge AI innovations. Beyond AI capability development, our partnership with AISG will help grow the DIS digital fighting force to defend Singapore in the digital domain, and contribute to the national AI talent pipeline through various schemes such as the Digital Work-Learn Scheme.\"\n\n[1]Servicemen under the WLS will serve for four years as Digital Specialists in the SAF, in a combination of full-time National Service and Regular service, developing data science, software development and AI skills through vocational, on-the-job and academic training. \nAbout AI Singapore\nAI Singapore (AISG) is a national AI programme launched by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore to anchor deep national capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) to create social and economic impacts through AI, grow the local talent, build an AI ecosystem, and put Singapore on the world map.\nAISG brings together Singapore-based research institutions and the vibrant ecosystem of AI start-ups and companies developing AI products to perform applications-inspired research, grow the knowledge, create the tools, and develop the talent to power Singapore's AI efforts.\nAISG is driven by a government-wide partnership comprising NRF, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), Economic Development Board (EDB), Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), SGInnovate, and the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS).\nDetails of some of its programmes can be found below:\n-\u00a0100 Experiments (100E)\n-\u00a0AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP)\n-\u00a0LearnAI\nFor more information on AISG and its programmes, please visit: www.aisingapore.org\nAI Singapore's Social Media Channels:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/aisingapore\nInstagram: @ai_singapore\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/aisingapore/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AISingapore\n\nAbout The DIS\nAs part of the transformation of the Next Generation SAF, the Digital and Intelligence Service, the fourth Service of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was established in 2022.

Within total defence\u2026there will be economic defence and of course, military\u2026 Within the economy, trade is very important\u2026a huge part of it is actually done by sea\u2026.For this reason, our Navy has to be effective has been making sustained continual investments in their capability\u2026so that they can defend Singapore's paramount interest in the seas around us, keeping those sea lines open.\"\nMs Trina Liang, Co-Chair of ACCORD Family and Community Council, shared how the visit had given her greater insight into the importance of having a strong maritime capability. She said, \"COVID-19 has shown how disruptions to global supply chains has affected the way of life of Singaporeans. With our strong reliance on the sea to bring our daily essentials to Singapore, it is critical that we build a strong maritime force to deter and minimise potential disruptions. Through today's visit, I really found out more of how the Singapore Navy carries out its mission through deterrence and diplomacy. It was interesting to visit warships from the other nations that were here as part of IMDEX Asia 2023. In my interactions with the foreign and RSN personnel, it was clear that IMDEX was a useful platform for them to interact and exchange views on the importance and value of their roles.\"\nMs Tan See Leng, Executive Director of Heartware Network and also Member of ACCORD Family and Community Council appreciated the opportunity to visit the foreign warships and speak to RSN personnel. She said, \"The work of our RSN Servicemen and women at sea are often out of sight and many of us might not be aware of what their job entails. As an island, Singapore's long coastline makes us exceptionally vulnerable to seaborne threats. I am glad that they have been always there to guard against potential aggressors that threaten our existence. I am extremely thankful to have the opportunity to better understand their important roles in safeguarding the security of our maritime home. I also thank them for their sacrifice when they deploy for operations and exercise.\"\nAbout ACCORD\nEstablished in 1984, ACCORD continues to strengthen support for NS and defence among the education, business and community sectors and to cultivate greater appreciation for the contributions of our national servicemen. In commemoration of NS55 last year, ACCORD launched initiatives such as ACCORD Employers & Business Council's StayFit@Work Challenge, ACCORD Family & Community Council's NS55 Fitness Challenge and ACCORD Educational Institution Council's TikTok Dance Challenge. ACCORD members continues to rally partners within their networks to co-create and co-deliver ground-up initiatives in support of NS and TD.\n\n[1]Delegates and visitors attending IMDEX Asia 2023 were treated to displays and tours of 22 ships from 13 countries between 4 to 5 May 2023.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, LG Ong led the SAF's pandemic response and ensured the SAF maintained a high degree of operational readiness while minimising the risk of infections. In addition, he oversaw the formation of various SAF Task Forces, comprising more than 7,000 personnel, to support the Government's COVID-19 operations. Under LG Ong's stewardship, the SAF made significant progress in its next generation transformation efforts.

Numerous new warfighting capabilities were also inducted into the SAF to enhance situational awareness with added lethality and flexibility. Beyond our shores, LG Ong strengthened defence relations and professional collaborations with foreign militaries, raising the SAF's standing as a valuable defence partner. Under his charge, the SAF conducted several major humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations such as supporting airlift operations of Afghanistan evacuees in 2021. LG Ong also led the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility which brings together partner nations to combat terrorism.\nThe change of command is part of the continuing process of leadership renewal in the SAF.

These included supporting contact tracing, stabilising the outbreak in migrant worker dormitories as well as scaling up of the national home recovery programme.\nUnder LG Ong's stewardship, the SAF increased the pace of its next generation transformation efforts and made significant progress in several areas. Key structural shifts were initiated to enable the SAF to operate in a rapidly changing operational environment. Notably, the establishment of the SAF's fourth Service, the Digital and Intelligence Service, has set the path the SAF to develop its capabilities in the digital battlespace, and to operate as a more integrated and networked SAF in the more complex threat landscape of the future. New warfighting capabilities were inducted into the SAF to enhance situational awareness with added lethality and flexibility. These included the completion of the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF's) Island Air Defence system, operationalisation of the Army's Third Generation Combined Arms Division and launch of the RSN's Invincible-Class Type-218G submarines. Advanced unmanned systems such as the RSAF's Orbiter 4 Close-Range Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and the RSN's Maritime Security Unmanned Surface Vessel were added into the SAF's capabilities. The year-long NS55 campaign was successfully executed, culminating in an integrated NS55 Parade in November 2022 to recognise our National Servicemen and reaffirm our commitment towards National Service.\nBeyond our shores, LG Ong has been instrumental in fostering good defence relations and professional collaborations with foreign militaries, raising the SAF's international standing and positioning it as a valuable defence partner regionally and internationally. The SAF stood ready to offer a helping hand to those in need. Under his charge, the SAF also conducted several major humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations such as supporting airlift operations of Afghanistan evacuees in 2021. LG Ong also led the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility which brings together Partner Nations to combat terrorism.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) expresses its deep appreciation to LG Ong for his sterling leadership and outstanding contributions to the SAF. LG Ong will continue to serve in the Public Service after he steps down from the SAF.\nThe incoming CDF, RADM Beng, 41, joined the SAF in 2000 and was awarded the President's Scholarship as well as the SAF Overseas Scholarship. Prior to his appointment as CNV in Mar 2020, RADM Beng held other appointments in MINDEF and the SAF, including Commanding Officer of the Formidable-class frigate RSS Intrepid, Commanding Officer of the Frigate Squadron, Director of the Defence Policy Office, Fleet Commander, and Chief of Staff \u2013 Naval Staff.\nUnder RADM Beng's leadership, the RSN pursued organisational changes and capability development to prepare for the future. These included the operationalisation of the Maritime Security and Response Flotilla to protect Singapore's territorial waters and respond to expanded maritime security threats; strengthening of the RSN's Engineering and Logistics system; launch of the second and third Invincible-class submarines; and the operationalisation of a Whole-of-Government sense-making system to improve inter-agency security coordination at sea. He also led the inter-agency Crisis Management Group that deals with maritime security risks such as terrorist threats, and oversaw maritime security operations during major national events such as our National Day celebrations and the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders' Retreat 2022 in Bintan.\nAs CNV, RADM Beng also steered the RSN through the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to safeguard Singapore's sovereignty and security. Under RADM Beng's leadership, the RSN furthered Singapore's defence policy space during the pandemic through COVID-19 safe exercises at sea, virtual engagements with defence partners, and safe conduct of the 7th International Maritime Security Conference, the first large-scale maritime conference held since the start of the pandemic.\nThe incoming CNV, RADM Wat, 39, joined the SAF in 2002 and was awarded the SAF Overseas Scholarship. He holds a Bachelor of Arts and Science (Mathematics and Philosophy) and a Master of Science (Management Science and Engineering) from Stanford University, USA, and a Master of Business Administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. During the course of his military career, RADM Wat has held, amongst others, the appointments of Commanding Officer of the Formidable-class frigate RSS Supreme, Deputy Commander of Maritime Security Task Force/Maritime Security Command, Director of the Defence Policy Office, and Fleet Commander.",

        "article": "Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How officiated the launch of the Kranji Regional Health Hub (KRHH) today at Kranji Camp III. The first of six Regional Health Hubs to be established across Singapore, the KRHH will serve as a central node to provide one-stop healthcare for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps in the north-western region, supporting Kranji Camps I, II, III, Mandai Hill Camp, SAF Detention Barracks, and Stagmont Camp. Through the regionalisation of healthcare, the SAF seeks to bring enhanced and specialised healthcare closer to service personnel.\nIn addition to routine primary healthcare and emergency services, the KRHH will be equipped with a suite of enhanced medical, dental, specialist and diagnostic capabilities, as well as offer telehealth services such as virtual consultations, to enable one-stop treatment and screening services. By housing these capabilities under one roof, KRHH aims to improve the quality of care and provide greater convenience to service personnel. The new two-storey medical facility will also have an increased patient capacity of ten consultation rooms and is designed to be pandemic-ready, with negative pressured consultation and isolation rooms capable of segregating airflows to minimise cross-contamination risks.\nThe KRHH will serve as a test-bed to pilot innovative features to improve healthcare delivery and patient experience in the SAF. New initiatives developed in partnership with ST Logistics include the automated Medical Dispensary System and MEDBOX. These efforts aim to streamline end-to-end peacetime pharmaceutical logistics, reduce the probability of medication error, and improve patient experience.\nRemarking on the increasing healthcare demands within the SAF, SMS Heng highlighted that establishing KRHH marks a critical milestone in the SAF's medical transformation journey towards delivering robust and holistic healthcare conveniently located within a single location. He said, \"Health has always been very central to the SAF. Through the conceptualisation and operationalisation of the Regional Hub concept, this being the first, the KRHH brings together the latest in technology, key processes and management processes, so as to tap into the efficiency of arrangements and at the same time, to leverage technology with the aim of bringing more convenience to the service personnel.\"\nSMS Heng was accompanied by Chief of Army Major-General David Neo, and senior officers from the SAF and DSTA.",

The MYL Roundtable, held on the sidelines of the 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC)[1], brings together young leaders from governments, think-tanks and the private sector from Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the United States to discuss issues related to foreign and security policy.\nAt the session, Dr Ng interacted with 20 young and upcoming leaders from 14 countries. He spoke about key global challenges and discussed the challenges that the younger generation will inherit. He said, \"To greater or lesser extents, the challenges that you will inherit are all existential, meaning that the forces they generate of these challenges can either decimate our physical world or our current social-political systems.\"\nDr Ng also sought the young leaders' views on their goals, aspirations and the hopes of their generation, and the world that they hope it to be. He listed some aspirational goals that could help shape that envisaged world. He said, \"One goal for all of us is to end the oppression and marginalisation of different groups, whether it is gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, and political persuasion \u2026 Second is to alleviate poverty. Apart from narrowing the gap, it is to raise the base \u2026 A third goal is to protect the fundamental rights of all citizens - proper education, employable skills for work, decent pay, clean water and law and order on the streets \u2013 because they are important.\"\nDr Ng is in Munich on a three-day visit to attend the 59th MSC from 17 to 19 February 2023 (Singapore Time).\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n[1] Held annually in Germany since 1963, the MSC is a high-level security conference that brings together key foreign affairs and defence leaders from around the world.

A ground-up initiative by the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD), this camp was organised by Ms Joanna Portilla, co-lead of ACCORD Family and Community Council Working Group 2, and supported by the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps (SAFVC). The camp aimed to give women a glimpse of what National Servicemen go through, so that they can better relate to their experiences, and demonstrate stronger support and involvement in National Service (NS) and defence.\nThis year's WBC was targeted at female youths, and it was attended by 31 participants. 1The participants underwent a series of modified activities that are an iconic part of the NS experience. New to this year's boot camp is an introduction to Urban Operations training and a Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle demonstration. Other activities include an introduction to the Singapore Assault Rifle - 21st Century (SAR21), the Standard Obstacle Course, a 2km route march and a 100m casualty evacuation. The first day of the camp culminated in a Total Defence (TD) focus group discussion and activity where participants engaged in a conversation on how female youths can play a larger role in NS and our nation's defence. The youths then pledged their support for Total Defence and discussed the roles they can undertake during a crisis.\nSpeaking at the event, Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Zaqy Mohamad highlighted that the maintenance of strong support for NS and TD is necessary for Singapore's survival, and that women can contribute by volunteering for future activities to support NS and TD. Mr Zaqy said, \"This Women's Boot Camp comes at a very opportune time as we celebrate Total Defence Day on 15 February. Recent events, whether it is the Russia-Ukraine war, or global supply chain disruptions, have shown us the importance of defence and how relevant it remains for our women to come on board\u2026 the activities in the two-day boot camp is a meaningful start for many of our women to have a sense of what National Service and Defence is all about.\"\nMs Portilla said, \"Women play a vital role in supporting NS, and can contribute collectively to TD by enhancing their individual and community's readiness, and will to act during crises. I am heartened by the support and enthusiasm shown by our participants, and I hope that they now have a better understanding of our National Servicemen's experiences. I strongly encourage more females to contribute to NS and TD, and do their part in safeguarding the defence of our country.\"\nThis is the third iteration of the WBC.

        "article": "Singapore, 10 February 2023 - Ahead of Total Defence Day 2023 on 15 February, four ground-up initiatives to strengthen Total Defence by youths were unveiled today. These initiatives were amongst 77 others that were submitted to the Total Defence Sandbox (TD Sandbox) since it was launched in February 2022.\nThe TD Sandbox encourages the public to share ideas on strengthening Total Defence and have their ideas brought to life through implementation in the community. By seeking ground-up ideas and proposals that put Total Defence into action, the TD Sandbox encapsulates how everyone has a part to play in Total Defence to keep Singapore strong, while highlighting the continued relevance of Total Defence in dealing with crises and disruptions.\nThe four initiatives, selected based on community impact, innovativeness, and alignment to Total Defence values, demonstrate how Total Defence can be manifested to foster thinking, engagement and conversations on threats and challenges that affect our everyday life. The selected initiatives are:\n\n\nTotal Defence Murder Mystery Role Play Game: Created by a pair of university students, it is an immersive social deduction game involving up to seven players, fashioned as a murder mystery exploring themes of evolving security threats which Singapore faces, such as terrorism and climate change.\n\n\nTotal Defence Trail 2.0: Designed by a team of Singapore Management University (SMU) students, the new Total Defence Trail 2.0 takes the public to Singapore's eastern areas to explore sites related to Total Defence, such as the NEwater Visitor Gallery and the Changi Chapel and Museum. Participants will also find out more about current topics such as water sustainability. The trail was launched in January 2023, under the GameOn NILA campaign in the ActiveSG mobile application.\n\n\nTotal Defence Tower Defence Game: Currently in the prototype stage, the game is designed and coded by a group of NUS High School of Math and Science students. It adds a Total Defence-themed twist to the classic tower defence game, a popular sub-genre of strategy games where players allocate resources to build towers to defend their territories against enemy attacks. The game will be launched at a later date.\n\n\nCommunity Table-Top Exercise: The table-top exercise (TTX) developed by a group of SMU students was adapted by Nexus for the upcoming Total Defence Day Commemoration Event 2023. The TTX aims to discuss the impact of pertinent contemporaneous issues affecting Singapore, and get individuals, communities and business owners to play their part during crises and disruptions through the development of community drawer plans. Co-organised by Nexus, MINDEF and the grassroots organisations of Chua Chu Kang, Bricklands, Keat Hong, Gombak, and Hong Kah North, the TTX will be held across two days on 13th and 15th February at Chua Chu Kang Community Club as part of the Total Defence Day Commemoration Event 2023.\n\n\nOn the public response to the TD Sandbox since its launch, Director Nexus, Colonel Goh Jerica said, \"We are heartened by the active participation and warm response towards the TD Sandbox. The Total Defence 2023 campaign will spotlight four ground-up initiatives by youths submitted to the TD Sandbox. Through the implementation of these ground-up initiatives by Singaporeans for Singaporeans, we seek to emphasise the relevance of Total Defence in our daily lives. We hope that more Singaporeans will be inspired to think of how they can play their part to keep Singapore strong against crises and disruptions. We look forward to receiving more submissions to the TD Sandbox with ideas on how Singaporeans can put Total Defence into action.\"\nThe public can continue to submit ideas to the Total Defence Sandbox. The next call for ideas will run from 9 Feb to 11 May 2023, with the selection of ideas and implementation phase taking place from 11 May to Jul 2023 and Jul to Dec 2023 respectively.",

Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen presented the award to GEN Narongpan at an investiture held at the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) this afternoon.\nGEN Narongpan was conferred the award in recognition of his outstanding contributions in strengthening the close and long-standing bilateral defence ties between the RTA and the Singapore Army. Key bilateral exercises conducted under GEN Narongpan's leadership, such as Exercise Kocha Singa and Exercise Flash Thunder, as well as the conduct of regular high-level visits, cross attendance of courses, and professional exchanges have strengthened mutual understanding and fostered close friendships between personnel from both Armies.\nOn receiving the award, GEN Narongpan said, \"I am greatly honoured to be awarded the MSM(M) from the Singapore government. Not only does the medal honour me, my family and the Royal Thai Army, it also symbolises the close ties between the Royal Thai Army and the Singapore Armed Forces.

A total of 109 servicemen and women, comprising eight from the Singapore Army, 41 from the Republic of Singapore Navy, 16 from the Republic of Singapore Air Force and 44 from the Digital and Intelligence Service, were appointed as Senior Military Experts (MEs) during the ceremony.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Mr Heng emphasised the importance of a strong and relevant SAF in an increasingly uncertain world. He said, \"The security environment is likely to continue to be complex, and fraught with uncertainties. Although hybrid conflict is not a new concept, the very nature of hybrid threats are to be by design, unexpected, and they will keep on morphing. There is no one single response to hybrid conflicts, nor a template that we can follow mechanically to achieve mission success. Thus, it is vital for the SAF to be well-positioned to undertake complex missions, and to counter all forms of threats, including hybrid threats, in order to continue to safeguard Singapore's peace and security, and our sovereignty.\"\nMr Heng reminded the graduands of the important role and value of Senior Military Experts to ensure that the SAF continues to build and acquire capabilities and the technological edge to defend Singapore. He said, \"In the face of ever-changing hybrid tactics by potential aggressors, you would be looked upon to create new and innovative advantages for the SAF. Over the years, the Military Domain Expertise Scheme, or MDES in short, has contributed to deep expertise in key military domains such as engineering and intelligence, and continues to evolve as a scheme to meet the SAF's operational needs\u2026 the scheme has been able to attract talented mid-career professionals from other industries to join the SAF \u2026Having colleagues such as these amongst us is an important step as they bring with them different perspectives, which will add value to our work in the SAF and in the whole defence ecosystem. This will add richness and rigour to our work, and allow us to better benchmark our capabilities against fast evolving industry standards.\" He also congratulated the graduands on their accomplishments and said, \"I am confident that this course has prepared you for the demands and challenges of leadership. After today, you will be looked upon to steer your respective unit and command to overcome the challenges of today's complex security environment, while you prepare to navigate the uncertainties of the future. You will be leading men and women, who will look to you for direction and guidance on how to discharge their duties well and effectively.

        "article": "Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How delivered the keynote address at the 11th International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) Sherpa Meeting this morning. Addressing an audience of senior defence and military officials and academics, Mr Heng highlighted how countries can adapt regionalism as a stabilising force to further strengthen the regional security architecture and regional security cooperation in this period of heightened tensions. He said, \"Our best option remains to improve and adapt various mechanisms \u2013 global, multilateral, and certainly regionally \u2013 through effective regionalism to serve the needs of our time\u2026 and I would like to offer here three suggestions. First, revitalising our collective commitment to build a cohesive region... Second, sub-regional groupings within Southeast Asia can be used to address more targeted issues\u2026 Third, regional organisations and institutions must be prepared to adapt their internal mechanisms and to adjust to new external realities.\"\nThe SLD Sherpa Meeting strengthens the SLD by providing an inter-sessional platform for delegates to engage in frank discussions on current defence and security issues. This year's SLD Sherpa Meeting is held from 15 to 17 January 2023 at the Shangri-La Hotel, with approximately 96 government and non-government delegates from 27 countries, regional groupings and international organisations participating. Widely recognised as Asia-Pacific's foremost defence and security summit, the SLD brings together defence ministers, senior officials and security experts to engage in discussions on key issues that shape the defence and security landscape of the region.

        "article": "Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen officiated the launch of the Heat Resilience and Performance Centre (HRPC) today at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine). HRPC is a tripartite collaboration between the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), NUS, and DSO National Laboratories (DSO) to leverage best-in-class local and global expertise, including thermal physiologists and climate researchers, to address the long-term challenges of maintaining human performance amidst rising temperatures in the region and the world.\nDr Ng also toured an exhibition where he was briefed on HRPC's research strategies, shown research ideas that HRPC is exploring to bolster soldiers' heat resilience and performance, and observed a demonstration of data collection and analysis using wireless body sensor networks.\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Dr Ng highlighted that establishing HRPC is part of the SAF's effort to mitigate the impact of heat stress on soldiers and enable them to continue to train and operate effectively and safely amidst rising ambient heat. He said, \"This is exactly what we have been doing for the past decade, our MINDEF/SAF/DSO doctors, scientists and engineers have been working with other national experts to deal decisively with and prevent heat injuries.\" Dr Ng highlighted how the tripartite partnership aims to further strengthen linkages between operations, technology and research institutions, tap into local and global expertise, and leverage key technology enablers like deep data science and artificial intelligence to develop innovative heat mitigation strategies. He said, \"The pool of local experts in the field of heat injury prevention is limited. The HRPC will tap into the best-in-class researchers from both local and overseas ... this work of HRPC will be increasingly important for the health of not only our soldiers but the general public as our ambient temperature rises.\"\nHRPC is a dedicated, one-stop research entity that brings together subject matter experts from the local defence ecosystem and NUS, to drive and conduct heat resilience and performance research to mitigate the challenges posed to training and operations due to global warming. HRPC will contribute to and leverage national efforts in relevant areas of research, and provide dedicated expertise support for MINDEF/SAF's long-term heat resilience strategies. Associate Professor Jason Lee, Director of HRPC also added, \"In addition to heat injuries and performance degradation, excessive heat stress can also compromise decision-making, leading to accidents. Not known to many, heat can be an enabler for physiological adaptations if we know how to use it correctly. HRPC seeks to add value to the expanding narrative of heat health and performance research to provide forward-looking solutions that proactively augments heat resilience in our people amidst rising global temperatures.\"\nDr Ng was accompanied by Chief of Army, Dean NUS Medicine, CEO DSO and other senior members from the SAF, NUS and DSO.",

The RSN has the crucial mission of keeping our Sea Lines of Communication open. Submarines provide the RSN an added capability to fulfil its role.\" Expressing optimism for the warm and growing defence relations between Singapore and Germany, he added, \"Our collaboration on this strategic capability underscores the depth of partnership and the trust between our navies and our defence industries. I am confident that the relationship between Germany and Singapore will grow from strength to strength, and I look forward to more meaningful interactions between our militaries.\"\nThe Invincible-class submarines are custom-designed for operations in Singapore's shallow and busy tropical waters, and they possess longer endurance and higher payloads.

He said, \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year cautioned us on the importance of maintaining a rules-based international order. It was also a sombre reminder that we must always have the will and the capability to defend ourselves against external aggression. A small state like Singapore must never take our territorial integrity and sovereignty for granted\u2026Today's uncertain circumstances may be different compared to the challenges faced by NSmen a decade ago. However, the dedication and resolve of our soldiers to defend our homeland have remained constant\u2026As we move into a new era, we must maintain strong public support for NS.\"\nMr Heng also thanked Singaporeans for their strong support for NS over the past 55 years. He said, \"As we commemorate 55 years of NS this year, we take pride in the national servicemen across generations who have contributed their time, strength, and unflinching dedication to serve and protect what we cherish; our families, our friends and our freedom to choose our way of life. This is only made possible through the strong and sustained support from their families, friends, employers, colleagues, and the general public so that they are able to balance their NS duties with personal commitments.\"\nIn commemoration of 55 years of NS, 3SG (NS) Suhairi Bin Samsudin, from the 906th Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment, handed over the state flag to REC Lim Wee Hong, a graduating recruit from 2nd Company, BMTC School 4. This symbolised the passing of NS duties from one generation of NSmen to the next. 3SG Suhairi who is currently a teacher with Orchid Park Secondary School, had inspired his former student REC Wee Hong to take up basketball, emulating his footsteps to be a coach and bring the best out in others.\nSenior Minister of State for Defence Zaqy Mohamad, Permanent Secretary (Defence) Chan Heng Kee, Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, Chief of Navy Rear-Admiral Aaron Beng and about 10,000 family members and friends of the graduands, also attended the parade.\nThe integrated parade will be the last parade held at The Float @ Marina Bay before the area is redeveloped into the NS Square next year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n[1] NSmen \"stand down\" after they have completed a ten-year operationally ready NS training cycle.

        "article": "Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen was the Guest of Honour at the annual Total Defence Awards Ceremony 2022 held at the Raffles City Convention Centre this evening. This year, 170\u00a0National Service (NS) Advocate Awards were presented to 71\u00a0Small and Medium Enterprises, 34 Large Companies, 43 Organisations and 22 Individuals. The NS Advocate Award is the highest accolade conferred on businesses, organisations and individuals in recognition of their exemplary support toward Total Defence and NS.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Dr Ng highlighted how security uncertainties and challenges have made Total Defence even more relevant today. He said \"A good concept stands the test of time, and Total Defence has proven it. Total Defence introduced in 1984 has helped Singapore weather SARS in 2003, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and of course the recent fight against COVID-19. What Ukraine has also taught the World, because I remind everybody, not many gave them a fighting chance at the start of the Russian invasion, is that the strength of a people's Total Defence is the most crucial factor between subjugation and independence. We cannot know yet the final outcome of the invasion of Ukraine \u2013 it is too early to tell. But of this we are certain: that there will be many stories of how the solidarity of a people, willing to fight with their lives held a much larger and supposedly fearsome military at bay. But we also recognise that no country builds such a solidarity and resilience overnight or even within a short time. And as much as we see the Ukrainians holding on, it takes deliberate effort and hard work.\"\nDr Ng also emphasised that Total Defence has proven itself crucial for Singapore to weather and overcome difficult challenges. He said \"In real life, all six pillars of Total Defence are connected and must work in tandem and reinforce each other to safeguard Singapore's peace and stability. The importance of Total Defence can only grow as we enter into an uncertain and unpredictable future. Total Defence is our anchor that will keep Singapore safely moored when the going gets rough. This is the decade or two decades of gross uncertainty and all the factors are colluding against peace and stability and we will be lucky if there is continuous growth still. We must tend to all pillars, ensure that each is sound. That way, our solidarity is ensured, and our chances of survival in an increasingly troubled World assured.\"\nAlso present at the dinner were Senior Ministers of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Zaqy Mohamad as well as Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim",

The establishment of the DIS marks a key milestone in the transformation of the Next Generation SAF with the consolidation and integration of existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) and cyber capabilities of the SAF. As a dedicated Service, the DIS is entrusted with the mission to defend the peace and security of Singapore from evolving and increasingly complex threats in the digital domain.\nSpeaking at the parade, President Halimah highlighted the importance of the establishment of the SAF's fourth Service amidst fundamental shifts in the global security environment, including threats within the digital domain. She said, \"Today's inauguration of the DIS is timely and necessary for the SAF to adapt itself to defend Singapore against the security threats that exist in the digital and information domains. In the past decade, we have witnessed many attacks on other countries, not through traditional armed conflicts, but through the digital realm. The impact of these digital attacks is real and can result in disruption of essential services, data theft and even local elections. Termed \u2018hybrid warfare', it can be a preamble or part of an orchestrated campaign against a target nation by state and non-state actors. Just as the SAF defends Singapore in the air, land and sea, the fourth service will provide us the capabilities to defend ourselves against attacks in the digital domain.\" President Halimah also reminded DIS personnel of their important role and urged them to strive towards excellence in their mission. She said, \"To the men and women of the DIS, you are the pioneers of a new Service. Always have the mission in mind, and embody the same pioneering spirit that your predecessors in C4I and across the wider SAF had, in bringing us to where we are today. Strive for technical and operational excellence, while staying true to the SAF core values and ethos. These will be key to your enduring success as a Service.\"\nDuring the parade, President Halimah conferred on the DIS its State Colours, which promotes a sense of identity and pride among the servicemen and women of the DIS and symbolises their loyalty to the Service. President Halimah also presented the letter of appointment to the Chief of Digital and Intelligence Service Brigadier-General (BG) Lee Yi-Jin.\nBG Lee, 42, who joined the SAF in 1999, has served in various command appointments, including Commanding Officer of the 21st Battalion Singapore Artillery, Commander of the 3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade and Commander of the 6th Singapore Division and Headquarters Sense and Strike. During the whole-of-nation fight against COVID-19, BG Lee oversaw contact tracing operations as Commander of the Health Surveillance Task Force in 2020. He has also held various key staff appointments, including as Assistant Chief of the General Staff (Plans) and Group Chief Policy and Strategy at the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).

He said, \"Now more than ever, the FPDA remains an integral part of our regional security architecture.

This year's exercise saw participants coming together as a combined joint task force to plan and conduct a joint campaign, which covered scenarios in conventional and non-conventional operations including Counter-Terrorism, Maritime Security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, and Non-Combatant Evacuation. As part of the FPDA's continuous efforts to enhance its transparency and build trust and confidence in the region, non-FPDA ASEAN representatives were invited to observe the exercise.\nSince the FPDA's founding in 1971, FPDA activities have grown in scope and complexity to meet the needs of the changing regional security environment. The FPDA has constantly evolved to remain relevant, and plays a pivotal role in anchoring the regional security architecture. The SAF's regular participation in FPDA exercises is a strong testament to Singapore's support for and commitment to the FPDA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n[1] The FPDA Consultative Council (FCC), co-chaired by Permanent Secretary (Defence) Mr Chan Heng Kee and Secretary General Malaysian Ministry of Defence, Dato Sri Muez bin Abd Aziz involves senior officials from the FPDA member nations.

The SAF's Chief of Army Major-General (MG) David Neo and the TNI's Chief-of-Staff TNI-AD (KASAD) General Dudung Abdurachman co-officiated the closing ceremony of the flagship bilateral exercise earlier today.\nThis year's exercise involved over 130 troops from the SAF's Headquarters 3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade (HQ 3 SIB) and 3rd Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (3 SIR), as well as 140 personnel from the TNI-AD's 1st Mechanised Infantry Brigade (Brigif Mekanis 1) and 202nd Mechanised Infantry Battalion (Yonif Mekanis 202). The exercise provided the opportunity for both armies to strengthen mutual understanding and deepen interpersonal bonds through professional exchanges in urban operations and planning processes, cross-training and a familiarisation shoot with the Singapore Assault Rifle-21st Century and the Pindad SS2 Assault Rifle-V1. The exercise concluded with a combined brigade planning exercise which culminated in a battalion-level field training exercise at Dawuan Training Area.\nSpeaking at the closing ceremony, MG Neo commended the successful conduct of the exercise and highlighted that the exercise provided a valuable platform to enhance the professionalism of both armies and strengthen mutual understanding and friendship amongst the soldiers. He said, \"Since its inception in 1989, Exercise Safkar Indopura has enabled our forces to improve our military capabilities through the sharing of knowledge and experiences. Over the years, we have seen the exercise grow from strength to strength, featuring brigade planning and combined arms training. Indeed, generations of soldiers from the SAF have forged close bonds with our TNI-AD counterparts.\"\nFirst conducted in 1989, Exercise Safkar Indopura underscores the close and long-standing defence relations between Singapore and Indonesia. In addition to bilateral exercises, both militaries also engage in a wide range of bilateral activities, including exercises, visits, professional exchanges and cross-attendance of courses.

Held annually since 1998, this year marks the resumption of MINDEF Volunteers' Dinner which was put on hold for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpeaking at the dinner, Dr Ng highlighted the invaluable contributions of the MINDEF volunteers during COVID-19 and the importance of MINDEF volunteers in an increasingly polarised world. He said \"We were in the thick of action whether packing and providing critical items, contact tracing, devising better diagnostic kits, or taking charge of various operations, including the Community Care Facilities\u2026We could have only achieved all of these because of the commitment of our people, including yourselves - volunteers tonight, who went beyond the call of duty.\"\nDr Ng also emphasised the need to build and sustain trust in National Service and Total Defence. He said \"MINDEF, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and Singapore must gird itself for uncertainties ahead and prepare ourselves as best as we can. In contrast to the loss of trust among key powers cited, the reservoir of goodwill and trust among Singaporeans remains a key asset.\u2026 Volunteers have contributed directly and strongly in building that trust through your individual efforts and commitment... if conflict is forced upon us to defend our home, solidarity among our own people will ultimately decide if we can survive. The exemplary commitment and dedication of National Service men, our MINDEF and SAF Volunteers and the support and efforts of Singaporeans give me hope that we have more than a fighting chance.\"\nThe volunteers serving on MINDEF boards and committees are industry experts in both the private and public sectors. Their contributions in diverse sectors such as law, medicine, counselling, engineering, science and strategic communications allow MINDEF to stay updated on industry best practices and organisational processes. Through their extensive networks, the volunteers also serve as the link between MINDEF and the public by promoting public awareness on defence and inspiring support for National Service.\nAlso present at the dinner were Senior Ministers of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, as well as senior officials from MINDEF and the SAF.",

It also brings together militaries from different countries to build understanding, but more importantly trust which is a very important commodity today. The FPDA exercises will continue to be relevant and updated according to the threats and challenges we face. The Chiefs affirm the importance of the remits and the relevance of this arrangement.\"\nThe FDCC, which is hosted alternately by Malaysia and Singapore, is the highest professional military forum of the FPDA and serves as an important platform for dialogue and exchange of views among the Defence Chiefs.\nThe Defence Chiefs were also hosted to lunch by Singapore's Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen this afternoon.

        "article": "The ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) Conference, taking place from 11 to 12 October 2022 at the Shangri-La Hotel, gathers CBR experts from ADMM-Plus countries and international organisations to strengthen the region's capacity to address CBR threats from non-state actors. Conducted in a hybrid format, delegates will exchange their views and experiences on topics such as CBR threat detection, response, and the use of new technology to address CBR threats.\nDelivering the opening address this morning, Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How highlighted that CBR threats cannot be addressed by any single country alone, given their transborder and transnational nature. Instead, international collaboration and information sharing among militaries and defence scientists can enhance the region's collective resilience against such threats. He said, \"In 2018, the ASEAN Defence Ministers recognised the need to strengthen regional counter-terrorism preparedness and cooperation against CBR threats \u2026 In this regard, today's conference has been a few years in the making. I hope that we can build upon this strong base of ASEAN cooperation to strengthen the whole region's resilience against CBR threats and serve as a good example of the benefits of multilateral cooperation against our common security challenges.\"\nUnited Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Ms Izumi Nakamitsu delivered the conference's keynote address, and highlighted the UN's efforts to strengthen international cooperation and global norms to tackle evolving CBR threats. She said, \"A holistic approach to addressing CBRN implies that essential and constructive as the UN's efforts may be, they are not sufficient for sustainable global impact. The multiplicity of factors necessitates a multiplicity of actors.\" She added, \"These factors are complex, inter-related and dynamic, but the solution starts from the same imperative: progress requires constructive dialogue and genuine cooperation. Without this foundation, no progress is possible.\"\nThe delegates attending the conference in-person will also visit the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives (CBRE) Defence Group this afternoon to witness a demonstration of the SAF's CBRE capabilities. This will include a display of capabilities in incident response by CBRE operators, casualty management and on-site decontamination by the SAF Medical Response Force (MRF), as well as a showcase of capabilities to forward deploy chemical and biological testing by scientists from DSO National Laboratories.\nThe conference is held under the ambit of the Network of ASEAN CBR Defence Experts, an initiative that was mooted by Singapore and approved by the ADMM in 2018. Over the past three years, the Network has organised workshops, meetings and table-top exercises to strengthen CBR cooperation among ASEAN Member States.1The ongoing conference extends these efforts to promote dialogue and cooperation to the ADMM-Plus countries.\n\n1These activities include annual meetings among ASEAN CBR defence experts, trainings conducted in partnership with the OPCW and IAEA, and a table-top exercise on chemical incident response co-hosted with Thailand. Most recently, the Network co-hosted a technical seminar on Biosafety and Biosecurity with the Philippines, as well as a workshop on COVID-19 Vaccines and Therapeutics Development with Cambodia. DSO National Laboratories serves as the Network's Secretariat.",

On board the HMAS Adelaide, he interacted with SAF and Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and engaged with SAF servicemen on the RSS Endurance. This year's XTD, a bilateral exercise between the SAF and the ADF, involves the inaugural participation of two of RSN's LST and the Royal Australian Navy's LHD, over 1,600 personnel from both nations, and features a combination of air, land and sea assets from the SAF.\nDuring his visit, Dr Ng also flew on board the RSAF's CH-47F and had a good appreciation of the close integration among the air, land and sea components of XTD, and the progress of the joint development of SWBTA. Dr Ng welcomed the steady progress made in the development of training areas and advanced training facilities \u2013 one of the key initiatives under the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The expected completion of the joint development of SWBTA is 2024. These developments will further enhance professional exchanges and cooperation between both armed forces and enable the SAF to train in an expanded SWBTA and a new Greenvale Training Area in Queensland.\nSpeaking at the end of his visit, Dr Ng highlighted the importance of the SAF's access to overseas training areas such as SWBTA. He said \"These Exercises give us a precious opportunity to sharpen the SAF's capability. I spoke with some of our troops and they share that these are very realistic training situations, which is actually a morale booster - because you get to test your own capabilities, you get to see it put all together, so it's very, very valuable\".\nDr Ng also talked about the importance of Singapore-Australia ties in the development of the SWBTA, as \"\u2026these early developments, as a result of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership has really boosted our confidence. A confidence not only in the capabilities of the SAF, and the training opportunities, but also the relationship with the Australians \u2013 we're building things together, we have shared perspectives, and because of that, I think we can explore further areas in which we can strengthen the military working ties. These opportunities are hard to get.\"\nThis year marks the 32nd year of the SAF's training at the SWBTA, and is testament to the close and longstanding defence relationship between Singapore and Australia. The SAF and the ADF share a long history of military cooperation, with extensive interactions that include bilateral and multilateral exercises, mutual visits, professional exchanges, and the cross-attendance of personnel for professional courses.",

As part of this partnership, NTUC LHUB will (i) organise quarterly SkillsFuture@NS career and education fairs (SF@NS Fair[1]) for NSFs in their last three to six months of full-time NS; and (ii) provide NSFs with access to a new SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform (SF@NS LXP), which will replace the existing Electronic Pre-Release Employment Programme (E-PREP[2]).\nSenior Minister of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How and Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim visited the SF@NS Fair this afternoon. During their visit, they were briefed on the features of the new SF@NS LXP, which will provide NSFs with unlimited access to over 75,000 online courses \u2013 a much wider range of courses than the 3,000 provided under the current E-PREP \u2013 as well as a personalised learning experience with individualised course recommendations.\nMr Heng and A/P Faishal also interacted with participants at the \"Network to Success\" workshop conducted by NTUC's e2i. This workshop is part of the newly introduced Employability Resilience series, which aims to equip post-NS entrants to the workforce with practical career skills, such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, networking and workplace communication. More than 50 exhibitors from key economic sectors[3] and about 20 Education Institutes were also present at the fair to offer post-NS employment and education opportunities to NSF attendees.\nSpeaking to the media at the visit, Mr Heng underscored the importance of supporting NSFs in their transition to school or the workplace. He said, \"The enhancements are an elaboration of our commitment to recognise the contributions of our national servicemen. This collaboration and partnership between MINDEF, MHA and NTUC LHUB is something that is long-lasting and value-adding. What we are trying to do is to create a platform that will be able to service and support all of our NSFs. It can potentially be of great value to all our servicemen on a lifelong-basis in the areas of skills-upgrading, understanding the job market, seeking for work and training. MINDEF/SAF, and I also speak on behalf of the Home Team, takes the contributions and the sacrifices made by our national servicemen very seriously. We fully appreciate and want to recognise that.\"\nA/P Muhammad Faishal said, \"We are thankful for the contributions of our NSFs and NSmen, both for MINDEF and MHA. This is something we continually look for, as to how they can prepare for their working life as well as continuing their education. This year, we are happy to be able to organise a physical fair. I am very appreciative of the support from the employers and education institutions, for coming forward and sharing with our NSFs, providing an opportunity for our NSFs to see how they can transit after their NS life, and at the same time, able to upskill while they are doing their NS. The enhanced SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform will enable them to access more than 75,000 online courses, allowing them to build their skills, interests and knowledge while doing their NS.\"\nAbout 4,000 NSFs from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) attended the SF@NS fair, which was held at the Devan Nair Institute on 20 and 21 Sep 2022. Mr Heng and A/P Faishal were accompanied by MINDEF's Deputy Secretary for Administration Mrs Elaine Ng, Chief Executive Officer of NTUC LHUB Mr Jeremy Ong and Chief Executive Officer of e2i Ms Caryn Lim and senior officials from MINDEF/SAF and MHA.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[1]The SF@NS Fair was previously known as the Enhanced Career and Education Fair.\n\n\n[2]Under the E-PREP, NSFs could use $350 worth of credits for a range of refresher and/or skills development courses provided by Institutes of Higher Learning and Education Institutes, to facilitate their transition from full-time NS to further studies or into the workforce.\n\n\n[3]Singapore's key economic sectors include manufacturing, electronics, precision engineering, and logistic and supply chain management.",

The CTIF is a multilateral, inter-agency facility that brings together like-minded countries to share intelligence and provide early warning against terrorism in the region. While much of the CTIF's operations remain classified for regional security reasons, CTIF is crucial to synergise counter-terrorism efforts with the use of collective intelligence and data-driven methods.\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony, Dr Ng said that the threat of terrorism remains high and increasingly fluid as terror networks have grown in sophistication. Dr Ng added that the CTIF initiative was only possible because of the invaluable contributions of all partners, which demonstrates our collective resolve to deal with terrorism.\nDr Ng also commended the CTIF on its achievements in detecting the spread of extremist ideologies in the region, which has led to follow-up actions by regional security agencies.\nSince operationalisation in January 2021, CTIF has produced timely intelligence products with Partner Nations, and assisted the region in the collective effort against terrorism. Dr Ng met representatives from the Partner Nations at the inauguration ceremony and thanked them for their strong support.",

Held from 28 August to 20 September 2022, the exercise involves approximately 180 SAF and US Army personnel, as well as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) operated by the 23rd Battalion, Singapore Artillery and the Multiple Launch Rocket Systems operated by the US Army's 3-13th Field Artillery Regiment.\nDuring his visit, Mr Zaqy received a brief on the conduct of the exercise and witnessed the precision strike capabilities of the HIMARS. Mr Zaqy also interacted with servicemen and women participating in the exercise and thanked them for their commitment and dedication. Speaking after his visit, Mr Zaqy expressed confidence in the SAF's operational capabilities and highlighted the importance of overseas training opportunities for the SAF. He said, \"I witnessed first-hand through today's live-firing exercise how the SAF uses such valuable training opportunities to conduct realistic and complex training that cannot be replicated in Singapore due to our space constraints. The exercise with the US Army has not only deepened cooperation between the two armies, but also has allowed the SAF to benchmark itself against its counterpart. I want to thank servicemen and women from the Singapore Artillery deployed here for their dedication and service. During my visit, I witnessed a high level of proficiency and a strong level of teamwork amongst our personnel as they conducted the live-firing exercise. I am confident in their commitment and abilities to defend Singapore when called upon.\"\nConducted since 2010, this year's exercise marks the ninth edition of Exercise Daring Warrior and underscores the excellent and long-standing defence relations between Singapore and the US. The SAF's training in the US provides valuable opportunities for professional exchanges between the two armed forces, which has strengthened cooperation and deepened people-to-people ties. The vast training space in the US also allows the SAF to conduct realistic training to sharpen operational competencies and enhance operational readiness.",

A total of 203 cadets, comprising 135 from the Singapore Army, one from the Republic of Singapore Navy\u00a0and 67 from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, were commissioned as officers of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).\nSpeaking at the parade, Dr Balakrishnan emphasised the importance of an operationally-ready SAF. He said, \"Singapore is a small, multi-racial, and multi-religious country at the heart of Southeast Asia. Our unique geography, our context, make us susceptible to an increasingly volatile, ambiguous, complex, and uncertain external environment...With increased contestation and hostility between the great powers in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, the space for dialogue, for diplomacy, for cooperation has shrunk. Conversely, the risk of miscalculation and misunderstanding has increased. For Singapore's survival and our well-being, the SAF must always be prepared to protect us from any potential aggressor. It is therefore imperative that we have a strong and credible SAF. \"\nDr Balakrishnan noted that this year marks an important milestone as Singapore commemorates 55 years of National Service and honours the contributions of generations of National servicemen. He said, \"This milestone would not have been possible without the commitment of generations of Singaporeans who have proudly stood up to fulfil our duty. The continued support and dedication from family, friends and loved ones during National Service plays a very important role in ensuring a strong SAF and keeping Singapore safe and secure. Singapore would not be where we are today without the collective support and commitment of every Singaporean to National Service. And we must build on this collective will, to look ahead, and ensure that NS is well-positioned to safeguard our precious way of life.\"\nThe parade marked the completion of 38 weeks of rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School. The realistic training conducted during the course sharpened the cadets'\u00a0combat, planning and leadership skills. The newly commissioned officers will go on to assume command, instructional and staff appointments in the SAF. Also present at the parade were senior SAF officers, as well as families and friends of the newly commissioned officers.",

He said, \"This year, we commemorate 55 years of National Service. Since 1967, more than one million of national servicemen and women have stepped forward to serve our nation\u2026the best way to show our gratitude is for each generation to continue to uphold this mission \u2013 protect the sovereignty and security of Singapore\u2026Your steady support for national service is vital to sustain our collective commitment to defence and to national service.\"\nThe graduation parade marked the completion of the 22-week Specialist Cadet Course, where the graduands trained under rigorous and realistic conditions to deepen their respective vocation expertise and further developed their leadership and combat skills.

        "article": "The Appreciation and Appointment Ceremony for the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD) was held today at the Float at Marina Bay. ACCORD Co-Chairmen Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Defence Mr Heng Chee How, and SMS Mr Zaqy Mohamad, expressed their appreciation to the 36 current members who will be stepping down on 24 August 2022 and welcomed 17 new members who were appointed.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Mr Heng highlighted the contributions of the three Councils in rallying strong support for and overseeing the implementation of various ground-up initiatives to good outcomes. He said, \"These are sampling examples of the efforts through the years and very positive outcomes. None of which would have happened automatically; all of which had only happened because of the commitment of the members of the three councils. Not only in coming up with the ideas, but also working very tightly together to see to the implementation to secure those results.\nMr Zaqy highlighted the positive impact of the NS55 ground-up initiatives led by ACCORD members to commemorate 55 years of National Service (NS) and the relevance of ACCORD moving forward. He said, \"As we commemorate 55 years of NS, we have seen the public come forth with various forms of support. We have seen ground-up initiatives such as StayFit@Work, NS55 TikTok Dance Challenge and overwhelming participation for the NS55 Fitness Challenge. Our initial target was just 55 million steps, but we have reached 550 million steps, 10 times past target.\" He added, \"In these times where national security becomes of utmost importance, especially the heightened sensitivities with what is going on in Europe with Ukraine, Russia, and the tensions in the South China Sea\u2026 this is where community comes together, Singapore comes together \u2013 the industry, employers, association and community, they all have a role to play as part of our Total Defence (TD) efforts.\"\nMr Neil Parekh, Chairman of Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICC), shared his enthusiasm in joining the ACCORD Employer and Business Council for a second time. He said, \"When I first served in ACCORD from 2016 to 2018, I was part of the team that was involved in the NS Mark accreditation scheme. Over the years, I have seen the scheme grow in strength with more supportive employers and organisations coming on board. As an incoming member for the new ACCORD term (2022-2024), I am honoured to be given this opportunity again to work amongst like-minded people to create opportunities for employers to support NS and TD.\"\nMs Samantha Ng, National Youth Council (NYC) Inspirit Youth Leader and SAF Volunteer Corps Volunteer (SAFVC), spoke of her initiative to commemorate 55 years of NS. She said, \"In commemoration of NS55, ACCORD members ideated and implemented various NS55 ground-up initiatives over the year. Leading the NS55 Fitness Challenge, I am glad to see the strong community support shown by the 2,400 participants who walked more than 550 million steps in support of our National Servicemen. This milestone exceeded our initial target of 55 million. I am pleased that such programmes are able to bring together members of the community from various walks of life in support of NS.\"\nIn the past two years, ACCORD has continued to strengthen support for NS and defence among the education, business and community sectors and to cultivate greater appreciation for the contributions of our national servicemen. Through initiatives such as ACCORD Employers & Business Council\u2019s StayFit@Work Challenge, ACCORD Family & Community Council's NS55 Fitness Challenge and ACCORD Educational Institution Council\u2019s TikTok Dance Challenge, ACCORD members have rallied partners within their networks to co-create and co-deliver ground-up initiatives in commemoration of NS55.",

In total, 18 active units and 12 National Service (NS) units are recognised for being the best in their respective formations. President Halimah Yacob and Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen will present the awards to the winners at the SAF Day Parade on 1 July 2022 at the SAFTI Military Institute.\n1 Cdo Bn achieved the Best Combat Unit in the SAF Best Unit Competition for the 19th consecutive year, and an unprecedented 36 wins since the introduction of the competition in 1969. Trained to operate deep within enemy territories, the SAF Commandos are renowned for their high proficiency in specialised operations such as airborne operations, reconnaissance, and raid missions. Commanding Officer (CO) of 1 Cdo Bn, Major (MAJ) Tan Rui Lin said, \"I am honoured and proud that the unit continues to maintain its standard of excellence, and this has a special significance to all of us this year. The 1 Cdo Bn is celebrating its 50th anniversary since its founding, and this is a testament of how we are able to uphold the traditions that have served us well. We have evolved and adapted to the more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, but what is common through generations of Commandos is the mental fortitude and sharpness of thought, directed by the understanding and belief in our purpose in defending the nation.\"\nThe Best Fleet Unit award is won by the RSN's Formidable-class frigate RSS Tenacious for the second time, the first was in 2015. RSS Tenacious demonstrated excellent warfare competencies and professionalism in numerous bilateral and multilateral exercises such as Exercise Eagle Indopura, Exercise Milan, Exercise Pacific Griffin, and the Singapore-India-Thailand Maritime Exercise (SITMEX). The Commanding Officer of RSS Tenacious, Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Tung Wanling attributed the achievement to her crew's dedication and perseverance. She said, \"It was a demanding yet fulfilling year for us. When many around us needed to hunker down amidst waves of COVID-19 variants, we remained steadfast in flying the nation's flag high across oceans. In these long deployments, we continued to cement partnerships and maintained our sharp edge. This win speaks volumes of the crew's tenacity, readiness and commitment to excellence. I am immensely proud of each and every individual aboard, and thankful for the personal sacrifices they had made with their families in defence of our nation.\"\nThe RSAF's 143 Squadron has won the Best Fighter Squadron for the third consecutive year since 2020. It is the Squadron's sixth win in total, and their fourth while operating the F-16 multi-role fighter aircraft. The 143 Squadron conducts a wide spectrum of air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, and maintains a high state of operational readiness and standards to support Singapore's round-the-clock air defence operations. Beyond the daily training and operational duties, 143 Squadron also participates in various local and overseas exercises to sharpen its combat edge, strengthen integrated operations across the SAF and hone each personnel's professional competencies. These include Exercise Bersama Gold, Exercise Bersama Shield, Exercise Cope Tiger, Exercise Elang Indopura and Exercise Pacific Griffin. The Squadron's participation in the Singapore Airshow 2022 was also testament to the precise flying and airmanship of the Squadron, and their engagement efforts allowed the public to better understand the RSAF's operations. Commanding Officer of 143 Squadron MAJ Joel Ng said, \"This third consecutive win of the Best Fighter Squadron award is testament to the high performance culture and resilient mentality that has taken root in the Squadron and our RSAF airmen and women. Apart from the dedication and commitment from each individual, our success will not be possible without the teamwork and strong integration with our Air Force Engineers from 5 Air Engineering and Logistics Group. This award serves to inspire the top guns in our Squadron to train harder, raise our standards higher, and continually strive for excellence as one RSAF tribe. We also recognise and appreciate the support from our families that has allowed our people to focus on safeguarding Singapore's skies.\"\nThe annual SAF Best Unit and Best NS Unit Competitions were introduced in 1969 and 1993 respectively to recognise units which have excelled in the areas of combat readiness, operational proficiency and administrative excellence. The units are assessed based on a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation process over the past year. The competitions also serve to enhance mission excellence, professionalism and camaraderie among servicemen in the SAF units.",

        "article": "Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Heng Chee How visited the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V this afternoon. Established in 2018, BMTC School V is a dedicated training school for PES C and PES E recruits, and plays a vital role in providing a holistic and common Basic Military Training (BMT) experience for service-fit servicemen.\nDuring the visit, Mr Heng observed the conduct of the Functional Assessment for Transport Operators. Designed to replicate the physical demands required of a Transport Operator, the assessment examines the physiological and functional capabilities of servicemen to determine their eligibility to be safely deployed in the Transport Vocation. The SAF developed the Functional Assessment for Transport Operators to improve deployment opportunities and enhance the National Service (NS) experience for eligible service-fit servicemen. This is part of the SAF's continual efforts to maximise the potential of Full-time National Servicemen and deploy them to meaningful roles for Singapore's defence. Mr Heng also engaged BMTC School V recruits undergoing component training and thanked them for their commitment and dedication to NS.\nSpeaking at the end of his visit, Mr Heng highlighted how the Functional Assessment for Transport Operators is an example of how the SAF continually explores ways to enable Full-time National Servicemen to contribute meaningfully during their NS journey, thereby enhancing their NS experiences. He said, \"Previously, we had deployed our manpower into combat and non-combat roles according to distinct Physical Employment Standards (PES). What we have found over the years is that certain things have changed\u2026 We are now able to look at the requirements of different jobs and say that it may be doable even though by the original PES system, you would not have been allowed to do so\u2026 If a person who may not be of the PES status that would originally have been allowed to perform this function, passed the eight-station test, they will now be allowed to be trained into that vocation.\"\nMr Heng also highlighted the value proposition of the Functional Assessment for the SAF to better fulfil operational requirements. He said, \"From the manpower point of view, we are able to access a bigger pool of transport operators\u2026 We are already seeing a 7% increase in the manpower pool for transport operators and this is significant especially when you take into account that our number of babies is actually not going up at any fast rate as well\u2026 But equally importantly, when you speak to the soldiers themselves, they really appreciate it because if I have to spend two years with you, I want my time to count for something that is functionally and operationally required.\"\nMr Heng was accompanied by Commander Combat Service Support Command Brigadier-General Terry Tan and other senior officials from the Singapore Army.",

A total of 923 cadets, comprising 787 from the Singapore Army, 45 from the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), 53 from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), and 38 from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)'s Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) graduated as Specialists and Military Experts of the SAF. This is the first full graduation parade at the Specialist Cadet School since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAddressing the graduands at the parade, Dr Faishal emphasised the importance of having an operationally-ready and capable SAF to safeguard Singapore from both traditional and non-traditional threats in an ever-evolving uncertain and volatile environment. He said, \"Given our reality as a small nation, we must not take our territorial integrity and sovereignty for granted. We must always be prepared to defend ourselves without relying on the help from others. This is why Singapore has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong SAF and ensure that we remain ready in the face of a rapidly changing operating environment and increasingly uncertain geopolitical outlook.\"\nDr Faishal also underlined the important roles the Specialists and Military Experts play in safeguarding Singapore's sovereignty. He said, \"The strength of the SAF does not only lie within its leading-edge capabilities, but more importantly, it is in our people and our shared commitment to enhance Singapore's peace and security. Graduands, as you step up in your role as leaders in the SAF in the face of an evolving security environment, you must always remain steadfast and resolute to safeguard our way of life and to protect the ones we love.\"\nThe graduation parade marked the completion of the 22-week Specialist Cadet Course for graduands from the Singapore Army, the RSN, the RSAF and SAF's C4I, where they trained under rigorous and realistic conditions to sharpen their respective vocation expertise. The newly graduated Specialists and Military Experts will go on to assume command, training and staff appointments respectively in the SAF. Present at the parade were senior SAF officers, and families and friends of the graduands.",

As a new and independent nation without strong military traditions, SAF soldiers carried the military IC instead of a civilian one to remind them of their roles and responsibilities to defend Singapore.\nOver the past 55 years, more than one million Singaporean males have served their NS dutifully. Singaporeans have accepted NS as a necessary commitment by enlistees to build a strong national defence through the SAF. We have succeeded in building a military ethos that has been sustained across a few generations.\nThe Ministry of Defence has therefore decided that NSFs and Regulars no longer need to surrender their NRICs when enlisting.

MINDEF will return the NRICs of serving NSFs and Regulars in phases.\nQ2. When will NRICs be returned to serving NSFs and Regulars?\nNRICs will be returned to all serving NSFs and Regulars in phases through their Unit Manpower Officers. The return of the NRICs will be completed by Nov 2022.\nQ3. Will NSFs and Regulars hold both their NRICs and their military Identity Cards (ICs)?\nThe military IC will still be issued to all SAF NSFs and Regulars as it continues to serve as the primary document to identify themselves as SAF service personnel. SAF personnel will hold both their NRICs and their military ICs going forward.\nQ4.  Will the Ministry of Home Affairs be affected by the policy change?\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs will also cease the requirement for Home Team NSFs to surrender their physical NRICs for safekeeping, starting from the batch of NSFs enlisting in May 2022. The NRICs of serving Home Team NSFs will be returned in phases. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will continue to issue the NS Identity Card to their NSFs, as it remains the primary document for identifying SPF and SCDF national servicemen.",

        "article": "Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen presented the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Overseas Service Medal (OSM) to SAF personnel at a ceremony held at the Ministry of Defence this morning. The 82 medals were awarded to SAF personnel in recognition of their contributions to support the multinational coalition efforts to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East; and to transport Afghanistan evacuees from Qatar to Germany.\nAddressing the OSM recipients at the ceremony, Dr Ng applauded their dedication and commitment in these overseas efforts, and said that international partners had shown appreciation for their significant contributions and professionalism.\nDr Ng highlighted the significance of the SAF's deployment to support counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle East since 2007, and said that this has been one of the SAF's longest overseas efforts. However, he cautioned that the fight against terrorism is not over, and said that Singapore and the SAF needed to continue to stay vigilant. \"Indeed, even as America and other partners of the coalition draw down, the threat to this region increases. Remaining terrorist networks may increase their activity. Additionally, operatives and sympathisers from this region that went to the Middle East and have now returned, would have gained training, expertise and connections. We must be vigilant therefore to watch for increased threats in our region, including Singapore\u2026This is the reason the SAF began the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility here in 2021, bringing countries together to share intelligence, monitoring and analysis capabilities. At home, the SAF must continue to hone its ability to respond to such attacks such as the recent exercise held at the Star Vista to simulate a hostage situation in an urban setting,\" he said.\nRecipients of the OSM also included personnel involved in the evacuation of Afghanistan refugees from Qatar to Germany. Dr Ng applauded the operational readiness of the personnel, saying, \"Within 48 hours of the US accepting the SAF's assistance, our Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) and 76 SAF personnel, made their way to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Chief of Defence Force, other senior commanders and I met with them at Changi Air Base prior to their departure, and told them that we were deeply impressed with the SAF's readiness to depart for this mission at such short notice.\"\nChief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, Chief of Air Force Major-General Kelvin Khong, Chief of Army Brigadier-General David Neo, and senior SAF officers as well as family members of the OSM recipients were also present at the ceremony.",
